    <p class="lead">If I could be anyone in the world, who would I be? I would absolutely choose NOT to be the
      guy
      writing a bio
      about himself right now. Let me switch gears and talk about my dog. I’m one of those big tall guys with a tiny
      adorable dog. I can’t help it if I like adorable things! And lets be honest, if you don’t like adorable things,
      you are some kind of monster that is well beyond reproach. My dog; his name is Django and he is a miniature
      pinscher. He weighs 8 lbs (used to weigh 6, the little tubber), and he has quite the plethora of nicknames. Rat,
      ratty, ratty cakes, rattems, doodles, princess, baby boy…you get the idea. In case you missed the point, he looks
      like a rat. Only with long legs like a little rat-deer. And he always has a snaggle-tooth hanging out. I acquired
      him used, and I had to have 17 teeth pulled. Sometimes that free dog you get? Yeah, not so free, after all.</p>
    <p class="lead">I suppose there are other things about me than my dog, but it seemed like an adequate lead in. I
      also enjoy(ish) writing and recording music from time to time. If you heard my music, which you probably won’t,
      you would think that I never learned what a major key was. It’s fine. The somber sad sound suits me. There is a
      cathartic element of writing sad songs that no one will ever hear, about how broken you are. I find It easier to
      keep myself honest that way..</p>
    <p class="lead">
      I also fancy myself a film and music snob. Yes, I call them films. I have impeccable taste, and you won’t ever
      convince me otherwise. Stubborn? Yes, quite. I think I’m finally getting to that age where it is hard to find new
      music that I like. It’s rare, but I do still find new music that appeals to me. It’s a similar sensation to being
      called for jury duty, and then never having your number called. OK, there may be a better analogy that someone
      smarter than me could write, but I’m only capable of so much.
